The script is developed for individual PCBs, OH-PCBs and sulfate-PCBs from experiments from Project 1, ISRP.

PREREQUISITES & DEPENDENCIES
--------

This section of the ReadMe file lists the necessary software required to run codes in "R".

Software:
- Any web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
- R-studio for easily viewing, editing, and executing "R" code as a regular "R script" file:

--------
SOFTWARE INSTALLATION
--------

This section of the ReadMe file provides short instructions on how to download and install "R Studio".  "R Studio" is an open source (no product license required) integrated development environment (IDE) for "R" and completely free to use.  To install "R Studio" follow the instructions below:

1. Visit the following web address: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
2. Click the "download" button beneath RStudio Desktop
3. Click the button beneath "Download RStudio Desktop".  This will download the correct installation file based on the operating system detected.
4. Run the installation file and follow on-screen instructions. 

--------
HOW TO RUN THE CODE
--------

It is recommended to create a project in RStudio and name it Metab-Partitioning. Paste and execute Subfolders.R code to generate the different folders. Then paste the MetabPartitioning.R into the R folder just generated. All the packages needed, with their respecting libraries, are included in the code. All the needed data are in the code. If needed, the fraction results can be exported as a csv file to the Output/Data/csv created folder.

--------
EXTERNAL DATA
--------

Partitioning coefficients were obtained from UFZ-LSER database:

Ulrich, N., Endo, S., Brown, T.N., Watanabe, N., Bronner, G., Abraham, M.H., Goss, K.-U., UFZ-LSER database v 3.2.1 [Internet], Leipzig, Germany, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ. 2017 [accessed on 08.05.2023]. Available from http://www.ufz.de/lserd.
Metabolites were obtained using their SMILE configuration.
